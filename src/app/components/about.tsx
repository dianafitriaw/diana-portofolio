        I am a nurse who decided to change my career path and pursue my passion for technology, 
        specifically web development. To make this dream a reality, I joined the Hacktiv8 boot camp 
        and completed the Front-End Development program, focusing on modern frameworks such as 
        React.js and Next.js. My background in nursing, combined with my new skills in web 
        development, gives me a unique perspective, and the ability to work with empathy and attention 
        to detail in building user-friendly applications.
